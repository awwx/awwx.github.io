 <h1>Expanding Macros with Values Instead of Names</h1>

 <p>
   In
   <a href="https://github.com/awwx/arc-globals-in-table#readme">Implementing
   Arc Global Variables with an Arc Table</a> I described how it was a
   small change to modify Arc<sub>3.1</sub> so that global variables
   were stored in a plain Arc table.
 </p>

 <p>
   This is nice for taking an
   <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ilc03.html">axiomatic</a> approach
   to language design, since there’s now one less feature needed to
   implement the core language: Arc<sub>3.1</sub> uses both Racket
   namespaces and Arc tables, and with this change Arc no longer has a
   dependency on namespaces.
 </p>

 <p>
   A module system for <i>functions</i> can now be built using the core
   language, rather than having to be built into it.
 </p>

 <p>
   For example, suppose I use <code>alref</code> in my code but
   not <code>assoc</code>, and perhaps I even want to use the
   name <code>assoc</code> for something else in my own code.
 </p>

 <div class="indent"><pre>(def assoc (key al)
  (if (atom al)
       nil
      (and (acons (car al)) (is (caar al) key))
       (car al)
      (assoc key (cdr al))))

(def alref (al key)
  (cadr (assoc key al)))</pre></div>

 <p>
  I can load a library which implements <code>assoc</code>
  and <code>alref</code> into its own module (that is, use a different
  Arc table for its global variables), and then copy only
  <code>alref</code> into my own globals.
 </p>

 <div class="indent"><pre>(= lib (copy globals))
(load "assoc.arc" lib)
(= globals!alref lib!alref)</pre></div>

 <p>
  I now have a reference to <code>alref</code>, which in turn has a
  reference to <code>assoc</code>, which is in its global variables but
  not mine.
 </p>

 <p>
  Using these primitives I can create my own module system, defining
  perhaps <code>require</code> and <code>export</code>, or however I’d
  like my module system to work.
 </p>

 <p>
  Sadly though while this works fine for functions, it breaks down for
  <i>macros</i>.
 </p>

 <p>
  Suppose I’d like to use the <code>after</code> macro,
 </p>

 <div class="indent"><pre>(mac after (x . ys)
  `(protect (fn () ,x) (fn () ,@ys)))</pre></div>

 <p>
   but I don’t myself use <code>protect</code>, and so I’d rather not
   have to import it as well.
 </p>

 <p>
   If I try
 </p>

 <div class="indent"><pre>(= globals!after lib!after)</pre></div>

 <p>
   I can go ahead and use the macro...
 </p>

 <div class="indent"><pre>(after (open-and-process-it) (close-it))</pre></div>

 <p>
  but it will expand into code which uses <code>protect</code>:
 </p>

 <div class="indent"><pre>(protect
  (fn () (open-and-process-it))
  (fn () (close-it)))</pre></div>

 <p>
   Since my code doesn’t have a reference to <code>protect</code> (or
   I’d like to be able to use “protect” in my own code for something
   else), that reference to <code>protect</code> isn’t referring to
   the “protect” in the library.
 </p>

 <p>
  In Scheme the solution is “hygienic” macros: since macros operate on
  expressions, the macro expander can automatically rename things like
  “protect” so that they don’t conflict with what I might be using
  “protect” for:
 </p>

 <div class="indent"><pre>(gs4926-protect
  (fn () (open-and-process-it))
  (fn () (close-it)))</pre></div>

 <p>
  where “gs4926-protect” is some unique name that doesn’t conflict
  with any of the names I’m using.  I’d still need to have
  “gs4926-protect” in my own globals (which may make having the
  ability to have separate global variables fairly useless if
  everything can be renamed anyway), but at least I can use “protect”
  for something of my own.
 </p>

 <p>
   Hygienic macros turn out to be pretty painful to use, and so for
   some of us it’s a solution worse than the problem.  It’s annoying
   if a library is making use some name like “protect” which I want to
   use myself, but I can just go into the library and rename “protect”
   in that library to something else if I want to.
 </p>

 <p>
   In Clojure the backquote character <code>`</code> is a “syntax
   quote”, which expands plain symbols into “fully qualified
   symbols” which include a namespace:
 </p>

 <div class="indent"><pre>
user=> `(a b c)
(user/a user/b user/c)</pre></div>

 <p>
   and <code>`(protect ...)</code> in the library would expand into
   something like <code>(lib/protect ...)</code>, where “lib” is the
   namespace of the library.
 </p>

 <p>
  Like hygienic macros, Clojure’s syntax quote solves the problem of
  name clashes by renaming.  It’s a nicer solution than hygienic
  macros, though it does come at the cost of making <code>`</code> no
  longer a simple abbreviation for creating lists.
 </p>

 <p>
   In Arc:
 </p>

 <div class="indent"><pre>arc&gt; `(a ,(+ 3 4) b)
(a 7 b)
arc&gt; (list 'a (+ 3 4) 'b)
(a 7 b)
arc&gt; (is (car `(a)) 'a)
t</pre></div>

 <p>
  In Clojure:
 </p>

 <div class="indent"><pre>user=> `(a ~(+ 3 4) b)
(user/a 7 user/b)
user=> (= (first `(a)) 'a)
false</pre></div>

 <br>

 <p>
  It’s a shame, as we have a small set of language axioms...
 </p>

 <ul>
  <li>“Global” variables are simply a reference to values stored in a
  plain Arc table.</li>

  <li>“Modules” can be created simply by using a different Arc table
  for the globals in the “module”.</li>

  <li>Quasiquotation is a simple abbreviation for constructing plain
  lists.</li>

  <li>Macros transform source code expressions into source code expressions.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  which seems to <i>almost</i> work for a module system... but doesn’t
  quite manage it for macros.
 </p>

 <p>
  In the expansion of the <code>after</code> macro, we want “protect”
  to refer to the “protect” function in the library:
 </p>

 <div class="indent"><pre>(protect
  (fn () (open-and-process-it))
  (fn () (close-it)))</pre></div>

 <p>
  while not clashing with my using “protect” for something else in my
  code.
 </p>

 <p>
  With hygienic macros “protect” is automatically renamed to some
  unique name that doesn’t clash with my code, and in Clojure the
  name is made unique by prefixing it with a namespace.
 </p>

 <p>
  And with that unique name, the code is able to get a reference to
  the function value, and to call it.
 </p>

 <div class="indent"><pre>(mac after (x . ys)
  `(protect (fn () ,x) (fn () ,@ys)))</pre></div>

 <p>
  Since the end result that’s needed is to get at the function value,
  rather than having the macro expand into the <i>name</i> of the
  function (and then later to get the value from name), why not
  instead have the macro expand into the function value itself...?
 </p>

 <div class="indent"><pre>(mac after (x . ys)
  `(<span class="outline"><b>,</b></span>protect (fn () ,x) (fn () ,@ys)))</pre></div>

 <p>
  This violates the principle that macros transform source code
  expressions into source code expressions.  If we look at the macro
  expansion:
 </p>

 <div class="indent"><pre>arc&gt; (macex1 '(after (open-and-process-it) (close-it)))
(<span class="outline">#&lt;procedure:protect&gt;</span> (fn nil (open-and-process-it)) (fn nil (close-it)))</pre></div>

 <p>
  that’s no longer a source code expression that we could type into an
  editor or save to a file.  It has the procedure <i>value</i> in the
  first list element:
 </p>

 <div class="indent"><pre>arc&gt; (type (car (macex1 '(after (open-and-process-it) (close-it)))))
fn</pre></div>

 <p>
  Arc<sub>3.1</sub> doesn’t like it either...
 </p>

 <div class="indent"><pre>arc&gt; (after (open-and-process-it) (close-it))
Error: "Bad object in expression #&lt;procedure:protect&gt;"</pre></div>

 <p>
  An error which is generated by the compiler:
 </p>

 <div class="indent"><pre>(define (ac s env)
  (cond ((string? s) (ac-string s env))
        ((literal? s) s)
        ((eqv? s 'nil) (list 'quote 'nil))
        ...
        (#t (err "Bad object in expression" s))))</pre></div>

 <p>
  Oh, but we can fix that!&emsp;:-)
 </p>

 <div class="indent"><pre>(define (ac s env)
  (cond ((string? s) (ac-string s env))
        ((literal? s) s)
        ((eqv? s 'nil) (list 'quote 'nil))
        ...
        (#t s)))</pre></div>

 <p>
  Now anything that isn’t otherwise recognized by the compiler is
  passed through unchanged, much like strings and numbers are.
 </p>

 <div class="indent"><pre>arc&gt; (mac after (x . ys)
  `(,protect (fn () ,x) (fn () ,@ys)))
#(tagged mac #&lt;procedure: after&gt;)

arc&gt; (def open-and-process-it () (prn "open and process it") nil)
#&lt;procedure: open-and-process-it&gt;

arc&gt; (def close-it () (prn "close it") nil)
#&lt;procedure: close-it&gt;

arc&gt; (after (open-and-process-it) (close-it))
open and process it
close it
nil</pre></div>

 <p>
  There’s another change to make if we also want to also be able to
  not only inject function values into the expansion of a macro, but
  also to be able to inject <i>macro</i> values.
 </p>

 <div class="indent"><pre>(mac n-of (n expr)
  (w/uniq ga
    `(<span class="outline">,</span>let ,ga nil
       (<span class="outline">,</span>repeat ,n (<span class="outline">,</span>push ,expr ,ga))
       (<span class="outline">,</span>rev ,ga))))</pre></div>

 <p>
  Arc<sub>3.1</sub> looks to see if a symbol is a macro by
  checking whether there’s a global variable of that name, which has a
  macro as its value.
 </p>

 <div class="indent"><pre>; returns #f or the macro function

(define (ac-macro? fn)
  (if (symbol? fn)
      (let ((v (namespace-variable-value (ac-global-name fn)
                                         #t
                                         (lambda () #f))))
        (if (and v
                 (ar-tagged? v)
                 (eq? (ar-type v) 'mac))
            (ar-rep v)
            #f))
      #f))</pre></div>

 <p>
  To allow macro values to be injected into
  expressions, <code>ac-macro?</code> needs to be extended to also
  return true when <code>fn</code> is itself a macro value.
 </p>

 <p>
  In summary, to review our language axioms:
 </p>

 <ul>
  <li>Global variables are a reference to values stored in a
  plain Arc table.</li>

  <li>“Modules” can be created by using a different Arc table
  for the globals in the “module”.</li>

  <li>Quasiquotation is an abbreviation for constructing plain lists.</li>

  <li><del>Macros transform source code expressions into source code expressions.</del>
 </ul>

 <p>
  By dropping one of our axioms, we can build a module system that
  works for both functions and macros entirely on top of these simpler
  features, and without having to do any renaming.
