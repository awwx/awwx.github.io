<h2>An Open Letter to Stripe:</h2>
<h1>Being Friendly to Developers Is About More Than Just The API</h1>

<p>
 I thought I might try accepting donations for a new programming
 project of mine that people might be interested in.
</p>

<p>
 I tested Patreon, but found it too complicated and unwieldy for what
 I wanted to offer.
</p>

<p>
 So I whipped together a quick integration with Stripe, famous for
 having a developer-friendly API.
</p>

<p>
 Today I was dumped:
</p>

<div style="background-color: #ccc">
 <p>Hi Andrew,</p>

 <p>Thanks for signing up with Stripe.</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, we will only be able to accept payments for a bit longer. Stripe can only support users with a low risk of customer disputes. After reviewing your website and account information, we've found that your business presents a higher level of risk than we're able to work with.</p>

 <p>[...]</p>

 <p>We're sorry that we can't offer you ongoing service and wish you the best of luck with your business.</p>

 <p>Best,
 <br>Mace</p>
</div>

<p>Does Stripe not support Patreon-style donation business models?</p>

<p>Or was my implementation too terrible in some way?</p>

<p>Doesn’t much matter.</p>

<p>Being “developer friendly” is more than just having an easy to use
API.</p>

<p>If, for example, Stripe doesn’t want to support Patreon-style
donations, they could say in their FAQ, “Despite using donations as an
example in our blog, we don’t support those kinds of donations”, and
that would be fine.  I’d know not to use Stripe for this particular
project.</p>

<p>Or, if say it was that there was something terrible in my
implementation, Stripe could let me know what I needed to fix, and
suspend my account in the meantime if they needed to.</p>

<p>But to boot me off the platform without explanation?
That’s... well, actually, to be blunt, that’s <i>terrible</i> customer
service.</p>

<p>And I care more about customer service than I do about having an
easy to use API.</p>

<p>Which means that if I have a choice, I’ll neither use Stripe for a
future project nor recommend Stripe as a solution to others.</p>
