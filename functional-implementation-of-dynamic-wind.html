 <h1>And a Functional Implementation of Dynamic Wind</h1>

 <p>
  Here I present a functional implementation of
  <code>dynamic-wind</code>, with code in
  <a href="https://github.com/awwx/arc-cps">github.com/awwx/arc-cps</a>.
 </p>

 <p>
  The are many ways to
  <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1010016816429">implement
  continuations</a>.
 </p>

 <p>
  Perhaps the most straightforward approach is to transform your
  program into
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style">continuation
  passing style</a> (CPS).
 </p>

 <p>
  In CPS, rather than returning a value from a function call, instead
  you pass an additional parameter, a function to be called with the
  return value.  Thus
 </p>

 <pre>
  (prn (+ 3 4))
 </pre>

 <p>becomes</p>

 <pre>
  (+ 3 4 (fn (v)
           (prn v halt)))
 </pre>

 <p>
  This transformation can be done automatically by a compiler.  You
  get to write your program in the usual way (the “before” code in the
  example above), and the compiler converts it to CPS (the “after”
  code in the example above).
 </p>

 <p>
  Matt Might has a terrific article showing how to implement such a
  CPS-conversion phase:
  <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/cps-conversion/">How
  to compile with continuations</a>.
 </p>

 <p>
  In a parallel article
  <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/by-example-continuation-passing-style/">By
  example: Continuation-passing style in JavaScript</a>,
  Matt Might also describes how implementing <code>ccc</code> in CPS
  becomes very simple:
 </p>

 <pre>
  (def ccc (f k1)
    (f (fn (v k2)
         (k1 v))
       k1))
 </pre>

 <p>
  It’s easy to see the “goto” nature of <code>ccc</code> here.
  Usually a function like the <code>(fn (v k2) ...)</code> above would
  call its <code>k2</code> argument to pass its return value on to its
  caller.  However invoking a continuation doesn’t return!  The return
  continuation <code>k2</code> is abandoned, and the captured
  continuation <code>k1</code> is called instead.
 </p>

 <p>
  This is a primitive form of <code>ccc</code>, one that
  ignores <code>dynamic-wind</code>.  Arc<sub>3.1</sub> doesn’t
  expose <code>dynamic-wind</code> directly, but it does make use of
  it.
 </p>

 <p>
  Consider for example <code>w/outfile</code> which opens a file for
  output, executes its body with a port to write to the file, and
  automatically closes the file when the body exits.  It does this by
  calling <code>after</code>, which is similar to the
  <code>try ... finally</code> clause in other languages.
 </p>

 <p>
  The file will be closed automatically regardless of how the body
  exits, whether it simply returns, or if an error is thrown, or if
  the body is exited with a continuation.  (<code>catch
  ... throw</code> is implemented using a continuation, so
  a <code>throw</code> that exits the body will close the file too).
 </p>

 <p>
  <code>after</code> is implemented using <code>protect</code>, which
  in implemented in <code>ac.scm</code>
  via <code>dynamic-wind</code>.  <code>dynamic-wind</code> lets you
  intervene when a continuation is passing in to or out of a body of
  code.
 </p>

 <p>
  The primitive form of <code>ccc</code> doesn’t do any of that.
  Invoking a primitive continuation is an unconditional goto.  In the
  CPS implementation of <code>ccc</code> I showed above,
  <code>(k1 v)</code> doesn’t stop along the way to close files or anything
  else, it just continues execution in <code>k1</code>.
 </p>

 <p>
  However, once we have a primitive form of <code>ccc</code> (whether
  by transforming code into CPS style or in some other way), we can
  then implement a full version of <code>ccc</code> which cooperates
  with <code>dynamic-wind</code>.  See for example the implementation
  given in the
  <a href="http://www.scheme.com/tspl4/control.html#./control:h6">Chez
  Scheme manual</a>.
 </p>

 <p>
  And, the usual implementation story continues, once we have full
  continuations and <code>dynamic-wind</code>, we can then use those
  to implement parameters.  (See for example
  <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-39/srfi-39.html">parameter
  objects</a>).
 </p>

 <p>
  In <a href="functional-implementation-dynamic-scope.html">A
  Functional Implementation of Dynamic Scope</a>
  I complained that I found the imperative implementation hard to
  follow.  I wrote a compilation pass which adds a hidden dynamic
  parameter to every function call and function definition.

 <pre>
    L0  --------------->  L1  ------------------>  L2
        macro expansion       implicit expansion
 </pre>

 <p>
  By using Matt Might’s CPS conversion code, I can extend my
  compiler with another pass:
 </p>

 <pre>
  L2  --------------> L3
      CPS conversion
 </pre>

 <p>
  The L3 language has dynamically scoped parameters and primitive
  continuations, but doesn’t yet have <code>dynamic-wind</code> or
  full continuations.
 </p>

 <p>
  The usual implementation of <code>dynamic-wind</code> can’t use
  parameters because parameters haven’t been implemented yet --
  they’re usually implemented on top of <code>dynamic-wind</code>.
  But I do have parameters already.  So with parameters, could I
  implement a functional version of <code>dynamic-wind</code>?
 </p>

 <p>
  Looking at the sample implementation of <code>dynamic-wind</code>
  <a href="http://www.scheme.com/tspl4/control.html#./control:h6">Chez
  Scheme manual</a>, it looks like a lot of the work being done is
  manipulating the dynamic state of the winders.  For example, in the
  code for <code>dynamic-wind</code> (converted to Arc) looks like:
 </p>

 <pre>
  (= winders (cons (cons in out) winders))
  (let ans (body)
    (= winders (cdr winders))
    (out)
    ans)
 </pre>

 <p>
  first <code>winders</code> is extended, and then <code>body</code>
  is called, and then <code>winders</code> is restored to its previous
  value.  If <code>winders</code> were a parameter, this could be:
 </p>

 <pre>
  (let ans (parameterize winders (cons (cons in out) (winders))
             (body))
    (out)
    ans)
 </pre>

 <p>
  In the implementation of <code>call/cc</code> (<code>ccc</code>),
  one of the things that the call to <code>do-wind</code> does by the
  end is set <code>winders</code> to <code>save</code>, that is, to
  reset <code>winders</code> to the value they had at the time the
  continuation was captured.  But we know that invoking a continuation
  already resets the dynamic environment.  If <code>winders</code> is
  a parameter, it will automatically be reset when the continuation is
  invoked.  So whatever else <code>do-wind</code> might need to do, it
  doesn’t need to reset <code>winder</code> for <code>ccc</code>.
 </p>

 <p>
  <code>do-wind</code> does a couple things.  It finds the common tail between the old winders and the new winders, and walks from the old winders to the tail calling the <code>out</code> functions, and walks back from the tail to the beginning of the new winders calling the <code>in</code> functions.
 </p>

 <p>
  Along the way it resets <code>winders</code> to the value it has
  when <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> are called inside
  of <code>dynamic-wind</code>, so that in each call
  to <code>in</code> and <code>out</code>, <code>winders</code> has
  the value it had at the time <code>dynamic-wind</code> was called.
  (This is important in case the <code>in</code> or <code>out</code>
  code itself captures a continuation).
 </p>

 <p>
  When parameters are implemented on top of <code>dynamic-wind</code>,
  when the <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> thunks are called the parameters  will also be reset to the values they had at the time the
  <code>dynamic-wind</code> was called.
 </p>

 <p>
  So, if I reset the dynamic environment in calls to <code>in</code>
  and <code>out</code>, that will get <code>dynamic-wind</code> to
  work correctly with parameters, and, with <code>winders</code>
  implemented as a parameter, will also get the <code>winders</code>
  correctly reset without <code>do-wind</code> having to do it.
 </p>

 <p>
  Fortunately I just happen to have a function to
  <a href="capturing-the-dynamic-env.html">capture
  the dynamic environment</a> :-)
 </p>

 <p>
  With <code>capture-dyn</code>, my implementation
  of <code>dynamic-wind</code> now looks like:
 </p>

 <pre>
  (def dynamic-wind (in body out)
    (with (xin  (capture-dyn in)
           xout (capture-dyn out))
      (xin)
      (let r
           (parameterize winders (cons (cons xin xout) (winders))
             (body))
        (xout)
        r))))
 </pre>

 <p>
  And the implementation of <code>do-wind</code> is simplified because
  it no longer needs to manipulate <code>winders</code>.
 </p>

 <p>
  Here’s the final version:
  <a href="https://github.com/awwx/arc-cps/blob/67cc6e5fc8260c24eb5d9f876b24bc3fd52615be/arc/ccc.arc">ccc.arc</a>
 </p>

 <p>
  And a demo with the CPS conversion pass can be found here:
  <a href="https://github.com/awwx/arc-cps">github.com/awwx/arc-cps</a>
 </p>

 <p>
  The demo runs extremely slowly.  I was also experimenting with how
  error handling could be defined in Arc (and thus how Racket errors
  thrown from runtime functions such as <code>car</code> could be
  forwarded to the Arc layer), and I needed an extra layer of
  indirection for callable Arc objects such as tables.  All of which
  probably would be faster in a runtime that supported the CPS
  language directly, instead of a emulation layer running on top of
  Arc.  But, sufficient to run tests and see what works.
 </p>

 <p>
  So is my functional implementation of <code>dynamic-wind</code>
  correct?  I’m not entirely sure.  I did write
  <a href="https://github.com/awwx/arc-cps/blob/67cc6e5fc8260c24eb5d9f876b24bc3fd52615be/runtime-tests/wind.t">some
  tests</a>, and they do run the same in my implementation as they do
  in Arc<sub>3.1</sub> (i.e. using Racket’s interpretation of the
  interaction of continuations, <code>dynamic-wind</code>, and
  parameters)... but naturally there may be some more subtle
  interaction that I didn’t think of and so didn’t write a test for.
  Bug reports are welcome :)
