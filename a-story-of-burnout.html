 <h1>A Story of Burnout</h1>

 <p>
  It’s a bit strange for me to be doing work related to Arc again,
  since the <i>last</i> time I worked on an Arc project five years
  ago, I burned out.
 </p>

 <p>
  And I didn’t really have a <i>reason</i> to burn out.  I mean, I
  was attempting the
  <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html">two-job route</a>
  (“to work at things you don't like to get money to work on things
  you do”), i.e. I took a part time job that wasn’t so great (but
  still OK) to meet expenses while I worked on my project, and I was
  living in a garage to save on rent, and I was unhappy with the
  direction my project was going... yet none of that was <i>so</i>
  terrible that I would have thought that I’d burn out over it.
 </p>

 <p>
  Yet burn out I did: I started acting weird towards people, and
  finally I said, “I need to stop”, and I stopped.
 </p>

 <p>
  I wasn’t until a few years later at a Steve Pavlina workshop that I
  got an idea of what had been going on.
 </p>

 <p>
  At the workshop (if I’m remembering this correctly, it’s been a
  while) Steve drew a graph of stress vs. effectiveness, something like:
 </p>

 <p style="margin: 2em 0; text-align: center">
  <img style="max-width: 20em" src="stress.jpg" alt="effectiveness is highest with a medium amount of stress">
 </p>

 <p>
  that is, too much stress makes it hard to be effective, and so does
  too little stress (i.e. lazing about on the beach or watching movies is
  relaxing but it’s hard to get work done if you’re doing it all the
  time).
 </p>

 <p>
  And Steve’s point (again if I’m remembering correctly) is that where
  people get tripped up is when they notice that their effectiveness
  is less than they’d like it to be and they try to do more of what
  they’re already doing: for people on the right of the graph (too
  much stress) the trap is to try harder (to add more stress to get
  more done); and for people on the on the left side (with too little
  stress) the trap is to try to make things easier rather than adding
  focus and discipline.
 </p>

 <p>
  I realized that what had happened was that I had fallen into
  the right-hand side trap.
 </p>

 <p>
  I’m used to overcoming a certain amount of laziness: I don’t
  particularly want to get up in the morning, but I get up anyway;
  there’s a project I want to work on, though I don’t particularly
  feel like working on it right this moment, and I get myself to work
  on it anyway.
 </p>

 <p>
  And so as I became unhappy with my project and my situation I
  pushed myself harder.  Until I burned out, and started acting like
  an asshole towards people, and finally bailed.
 </p>

 <p>
  What’s funny looking back on this is that it was all internal. There
  wasn’t any <i>external</i> bad thing that had happened to me: it was just
  me.  Starting to get a little unhappy, and then pushing myself
  harder, and then getting a little more unhappy... until finally I
  crapped out.
 </p>

 <p>
  That too much or too little stress can be bad for effectiveness is
  pretty well known, I would think, but the insight that people can
  respond to seeing their effectiveness go down by turning their
  stress dial in the wrong direction was new to me.
 </p>

 <p>
  So I thought it might turn out to be useful for someone if I related
  my story and they found themselves in a similar situation.
