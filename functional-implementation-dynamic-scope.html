 <h1>A Functional Implementation of Dynamic Scope</h1>

 <p>
  Dynamically scoped variables (a.k.a parameters, a.k.a. implicit
  variables) are usually described as being implemented by
  imperatively mutating global state (for example, see
  <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-39/srfi-39.html">
   parameter objects
  </a>).
 </p>

 <p>
  Here I explore implementing implicit variables with a functional
  implementatioen, by adding a hidden parameter to functions and
  function calls.  A demo (slow but sufficient to run tests) can be
  found on github:
  <a href="https://github.com/awwx/arc-implicit#readme">
   github.com/awwx/arc-implicit
  </a>.
 </p>

 <h2>Dynamic Scope in Arc</h2>

 <p>
  While Arc<sub>3.1</sub> doesn’t explicitly expose Racket’s
  <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/parameters.html">
   parameters
  </a>, it does make use of them.  For example the standard ports are
  dynamically scoped.  I can say:
 </p>

 <pre>
  (def f1 ()
    (prn "f1"))

  (def f2 ()
    (f1))

  (def f3 ()
    (tostring (f2)))
 </pre>

 <p>
  and calling <code>(f3)</code> returns the
  string <code>"f1\n"</code>.  <code>tostring</code> redirects the
  standard output port to a string during the execution of its body,
  and the execution of the functions its body calls.
 </p>

 <h2>Implementing Dynamic Scope</h2>

 <p>
  In a language without exceptions or continuations, I might
  implement <code>call-w/stdout</code> by storing the current value of
  the standard output port in a global variable such
  as <code>*stdout</code> and doing something like:
 </p>

 <pre>
  (def call-w/stdout (port f)
    (let orig *stdout
      (= *stdout port)
      (let rv (f)
        (= *stdout orig)
        rv)))
 </pre>

 <p>
  When we have exceptions in our language, we also need to restore the
  original value of <code>*stdout</code> when an exception is thrown.
 </p>

 <pre>
  (def call-w/stdout (port f)
    (let orig *stdout
      (after (do (= *stdout port)
                 (f))
             (= *stdout orig))))
 </pre>

 <p>
  An equivalent implementation in a language that has <code>try
  ... finally</code> such as JavaScript looks like:
 </p>

 <pre>
  function callWithStdout(port, f) {
    var orig = gStdout;
    try {
      gStdout = port;
      return f();
    } finally {
      gStdout = orig;
    }
  }
 </pre>

 <p>
  With continuations the implementation gets even more complicated
  because when a captured continuation is reinvoked we want the
  dynamic environment to be restored as well.  Arc<sub>3.1</sub>
  doesn’t directly expose Racket’s <code>dynamic-wind</code>, but if
  it did our implementation might look like:
 </p>

 <pre>
  (def call-w/stdout (port f)
    (let orig *stdout
      (dynamic-wind (fn () (= *stdout port))
                    f
                    (fn () (= *stdout orig)))))
 </pre>

 <p>
  Real implementations of dynamically scoped variables don’t use a
  separate global variable for each dynamic variable, of course.
  Here’s an implementation that uses a single global variable to hold
  all the dynamic bindings:
  <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-39/srfi-39.html">Parameter
  Objects</a> (in Scheme and Racket, dynamically scoped variables are
  called “parameters”).
 </p>

 <p>
  With <code>make-parameter</code> and <code>parameterize</code>
  implemented and <code>stdout</code> a parameter,
  <code>call-w/stdout</code> becomes:
 </p>

 <pre>
  (def call-w/stdout (port f)
    (parameterize stdout port (f)))
 </pre>

 <p>
  While one of the things I like about Arc is that it doesn’t
  pedantically try to force me into writing functional code when an
  imperative style would be more straightforward, implementing dynamic
  variables a.k.a parameters by setting and resetting a global variable
  seems a bit ugly to me.
 </p>

 <p>
  I don’t mind using global variables for things that are actually
  global but I dislike using global variables for local state.
 </p>

 <p>
  One of the ideas of Arc is that the implementation can serve as the
  language spec [<a href="http://www.arclanguage.org/tut.txt">Arc
  Tutorial</a>].  The imperative approach to implementing dynamic
  scope strikes me as being particularly far from that ideal.  I have
  some sense of how I think dynamic variables work, and I can
  inspect the implementation to see if it looks like it’s doing what I
  think it should, but I don’t get the sense that I <i>understand</i>
  dynamic scope from looking at the implementation.
 </p>

 <p>
  It gets even worse when we look at how we might
  implement <code>dynamic-wind</code>.  The usual approach is more
  imperatively modified global state.  (See for
  example
  <a href="http://www.scheme.com/tspl4/control.html#./control:h6">
   Continuations
  </a>
  in the Chez Scheme manual).  To understand how parameters interact
  with continuations, we need to look at an imperatively modified
  global state implementation of parameters wrapped around an
  imperatively modified global state implementation
  of <code>dynamic-wind</code>.
 </p>

 <h2>Hidden Dynamic Parameter</h2>

 <p>
  I personally like to call dynamically scoped variables “implicit
  variables”, because it’s as if the variable were being passed
  implicitly to each called function.  For example, if we were to pass
  “stdout” to every function, my example would then look like:
 </p>

 <pre>
  (def f1 (stdout)
    (prn stdout "f1"))

  (def f2 (stdout)
    (f1 stdout))

  (def f3 (stdout)
    (tostring (f2 stdout)))
 </pre>

 <p>
  and <code>tostring</code> as a macro could in effect expand into
  a <code>let</code> which gave a new binding for <code>stdout</code>:
 </p>

 <pre>
  (def f3 (stdout)
    (let stdout (outstring)
      (f2 stdout)
      (inside stdout)))
 </pre>

 <p>
  In this language, <code>stdout</code> is a simple lexical variable
  (which happens to be passed around a lot).  There’s no confusion
  about how <code>stdout</code> would interact with continuations
  here, because it isn’t any different than any other lexical
  variable.  For example, suppose <code>f1</code>
  called <code>foo</code> which might capture a continuation:
 </p>

 <pre>
  (def f1 (stdout)
    (foo stdout)
    (prn stdout "f1"))
 </pre>

 <p>
  If the function <code>foo</code> did capture a continutation and
  that continuation was invoked so that <code>foo</code> returned
  again later, what should <code>stdout</code> be
  when <code>prn</code> is called again?  Just what it is.  The
  original value of <code>stdout</code> passed to <code>f1</code>
  which hasn’t changed.
 </p>

 <p>
  We don’t need to restore <code>stdout</code> to the value that it
  had when the continuation was captured because
  however <code>foo</code> might choose to pass <code>stdout</code> to
  the function it calls, that doesn’t affect <code>stdout</code> as a
  lexical parameter of <code>f1</code>.  It still has its original
  value.
 </p>

 <p>
  So then I thought, what if I actually did implement implicit
  variables (a.k.a parameters, a.k.a. dynamically scoped variables)
  using a hidden parameter passed to every function?
 </p>

 <p>I could transform every function definition</p>

 <pre>
  (fn (a b c) ...)
 </pre>

 <p>to have an additional parameter</p>

 <pre>
  (fn ($dyn a b c) ...)
 </pre>

 <p>and every function call</p>

 <pre>
  (foo 1 2 3)
 </pre>

 <p>to include the hidden parameter:</p>

 <pre>
  (foo $dyn 1 2 3)
 </pre>

 <p>
  My compilation stages can now start with:
 </p>

 <pre>
    L0  --------------->  L1  ------------------>  L2
        macro expansion       implicit expansion
 </pre>

 <p>
  L0 is a dialect of Arc which not only has parameters, continuations,
  complex function arguments, etc., like Arc<sub>3.1</sub> does, but
  also
  <a href="https://github.com/awwx/arc-globals-in-table#readme">
   stores global variables in an Arc table
  </a>
  and
  <a href="http://awwx.github.io/expanding-macros-with-values.html">
   allows macros to be expanded with values
  </a>
  as well as with names.
 </p>

 <p>
  L1 is a more primitive language.  It doesn’t have global variables
  (those were implemented by the macro expander) or complex function
  parameters (macro expanded) or macros (all expanded by the macro
  expander).  Functions, conditionals, lexical variable assignments,
  and quotation are represented by primitives
  <code>$fn</code>, <code>$if</code>, <code>$assign</code>,
  and <code>$quote</code>.  It does have implicit variables and
  continuations.
 </p>

 <p>
  L2 is an even more primitive language, not having implicit
  variables (those got implemented by adding a hidden
  <code>$dyn</code> parameter to every function definition and
  every function call), but it does still rely on the target runtime
  for continuations and tail calls.
 </p>

 <p>
  From L2 I can go in two directions.  Like with my
  <a href="http://awwx.github.io/arc-macro-expander.html">
   Arc Macro Expander
  </a>,
  I could cross-compile to a runtime that didn’t implement Arc yet
  (but which does have continuations and tail calls).  I can also
  transform L2 back into Arc<sub>3.1</sub>, which isn’t particularly
  efficient, but does let me easily run tests to see if the implicit
  code transformation is working.
 </p>

 <pre>
  L2 ----------->  Arc<sub>3.1</sub>
     unprimitive
 </pre>

 <p>
  In the L2 (implicit language) runtime, each builtin function is now
  called with the hidden <code>$dyn</code> parameter:
 </p>

 <pre>
  (+ $dyn 3 4)
 </pre>

 <p>
  As Arc globals are stored in an Arc table, it’s easy enough to
  construct an initial set of globals containing the builtin
  functions:
 </p>

 <pre>
  (= ir (obj + (fn ($dyn . args) (apply + args))
             - (fn ($dyn . args) (apply - args))
             ...))
 </pre>

 <p>
  (Since error handlers are dynamically scoped, if I wanted to do a
  complete implementation I’d trap Racket errors and then invoke the
  error handler found in the dynamic environment.  Being lazy and not
  needing it for the demo I skipped doing that part).
 </p>

 <h2>Implementing ccc</h2>

 <p>
  It’s instructive to look at the implementation of <code>ccc</code>
  in the implicit runtime.  At the user language
  level <code>ccc</code> is called with a single
  argument, <code>f</code>, and at the implicit runtime implementation
  level it also gets passed the hidden <code>$dyn</code> parameter:
 </p>

 <pre>
   (= ir!ccc
     (fn ($dyn f)
       ...))
 </pre>

 <p>
  We need to call the real <code>ccc</code>, which takes a single
  parameter, a function which is also called with a single parameter,
  the continuation:
 </p>

 <pre>
   (= ir!ccc
     (fn ($dyn f)
       (ccc (fn (c)
              ...))))
 </pre>

 <p>
  We then need to call the user function <code>f</code> with the
  continuation, and being a user function, <code>f</code> also takes
  the hidden <code>$dyn</code> parameter.  We only have one dynamic
  environment available to give it, so we have no choice but to use
  the <code>$dyn</code> we have:
 </p>

 <pre>
   (= ir!ccc
     (fn ($dyn f)
       (ccc (fn (c)
              (f $dyn (fn ...))))))
 </pre>

 <p>
  The user function gets called with a continuation.  At the user
  language level, the user will call the continuation with a single
  argument, the value to return from the captured continuation.  Since
  that function call will include the hidden <code>$dyn</code>
  parameter, the continution function we supply has to have both
  parameters:
 </p>

 <pre>
  (= ir!ccc
    (fn ($dyn f)
      (ccc (fn (c)
             (f $dyn (fn ($dyn2 v)
                       ...))))))
 </pre>

 <p>
  Now we have two dynamic environments, the dynamic environment at the
  time the continuation was captured (<code>$dyn</code>), and the
  dynamic environment at the time the continuation is invoked
  (<code>$dyn2</code>).  Which one is the continuation invoked with?
 </p>

 <p>
  We don’t actually have a choice here either.  The real
  continuation <code>c</code> is only called with a single argument
  (the value for the continuation to return).  There’s no place
  for <code>$dyn2</code> to go.
 </p>

 <pre>
  (= ir!ccc
    (fn ($dyn f)
      (ccc (fn (c)
             (f $dyn (fn ($dyn2 v)
                       (c v)))))))
 </pre>

 <p>
  So if we implement implicit variables using this hidden parameter
  approach, we’re inexorably led to invoked continuations having the
  dynamic environment of the captured continuation, not the dynamic
  environment of the code calling the continuation.
 </p>

 <p>
  Which isn’t <i>surprising</i> since it was by design that as a
  lexical variable, the hidden <code>$dyn</code> parameter couldn’t be
  affected by continuations.  But it’s still neat to see it fit
  together.
 </p>

 <p>
  We can check this with a test:
 </p>

 <pre>
  (with (a (parameter)
         c1 nil
         x  0)
    (parameterize a 123
      (ccc (fn (c)
             (= c1 c)
             nil))           ; 1
      (test (a) 123))        ; 2
    (++ x)
    (if (is x 1)
      (parameterize a 456    ; 3
        (c1 nil))))          ; 4
 </pre>

 <p>
  The test at 2 gets run twice.  The first time when <code>ccc</code>
  returns at 1, and naturally the value of the
  parameter <code>a</code> is 123 as parameterized above.
  Later <code>a</code> is parameterized to 456.  If <code>c1</code>
  were a regular function call, <code>a</code> would have the value of
  456 during that execution, but since <code>c1</code> is a captured
  continuation the dynamic environment is also restored, and at
  2 <code>a</code> is 123 again.
 </p>

 <p>
  The test runs the same way in both Arc<sub>3.1</sub>
  (extended with Racket’s implementation of
  <code>parameter</code> and <code>parameterize</code> and in the
  implicit language implementation of the demo.
 </p>

 <h2>The Implicit Runtime</h2>

 <p>
  A small complication is that in Arc values such as tables, lists and
  strings can also be called.  If I had written a target runtime, it
  would be easy enough to have <code>ar-apply</code> (or its
  equivalent) accept the additional hidden parameter.  For the demo
  running on top of Arc<sub>3.1</sub>, the quick and easy thing to do
  was to have function calls actually expand into a call
  to <code>implicit-call</code>... i.e., rather than having <code>(+ 3
  4)</code> just expand into <code>(+ $dyn 3 4)</code>, instead have
  it expand into <code>(implicit-call + $dyn 3
  4)</code>.  <code>implicit-call</code> then handles dropping
  the <code>$dyn</code> parameter when calling non-function values.
  In a more serious implementation, the extra layer of indirection can
  be avoided by having the runtime accept the <code>$dyn</code>
  parameter for calls to non-functions.
 </p>

 <p>
  Another complication is calling macros from the macro expander.
  When the macro expander is loaded into L2, it naturally calls macros
  with the hidden <code>$dyn</code> because all function calls made at
  the L2 level have the extra parameter added.  The macro expander
  neither knows nor cares whether implicit variables are implemented
  with Racket parameters or with <code>$dyn</code>, it just needs to
  call the macro function:
 </p>

 <pre>
  (apply (rep m) args)
 </pre>

 <p>
  However since the macro expander is written in Arc, to bootstrap
  into running the L2 language we need to first load the macro
  expander into Arc<sub>3.1</sub> so that we have something running to
  cross-compile to L2.  In this scenario the macro expander is calling
  macros loaded into L2, but is itself running in Arc<sub>3.1</sub>,
  so it needs to explicitly pass the <code>$dyn</code> parameter that
  the L2 macro function expect.  To do this I add a compilation option
  to specify the dynamic environment to pass into the macro:
 </p>

 <pre>
  (apply (rep m) compile!xcompile-dyn args)
 </pre>
