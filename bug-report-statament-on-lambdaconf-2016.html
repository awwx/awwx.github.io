 <h1>A bug report for the “Statement on LambdaConf 2016”</h1>

 <p>
  As a programmer, I’m well familiar with the problem that
  the <i>outcome</i> of the code I write doesn’t depend on my <i>good
  intentions</i>, but on the logical consequence of what I actually
  wrote.
 </p>

 <p>
  Thus, in case it would be helpful, I’d like to offer a bug report for
  the Statement.
 </p>

 <p>
  To summarize, the Statement advocates banning Yarvin from
  giving a technical talk about Urbit at LambdaConf in order to:
 </p>

 <ul>
  <li>
   Say to marginalized people that their humanity is not up for
   debate.
  </li>
  <li>
   Protect the vulnerable.
  </li>
  <li>
   Extend a warm welcome to those who have been systemically excluded.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Protecting the vulnerable</h2>

 <p>
  From the posts linked from the Statement, I understand that banning
  Yarvin would protect the vulnerable in several ways:
 </p>

 <ul>
  <li>
   People who have been systemically excluded and marginalized find
   Yarvin’s “Moldbug” writings so sickening and abhorrent that they
   have no desire to attend a conference that has him giving a
   technical talk, and so they end up being yet again excluded.
  </li>
  <li>
   The respect Yarvin’s gains from having his technical work
   acknowledged might enhance his credibility, which may further
   encourage those who use his “Moldbug” writings as an excuse to
   harrass, intimidate, and bully others.
  </li>
  <li>
   The failure to ban Yarvin suggests that LambdaConf isn’t taking
   racism seriously, which raises fears among those who might want to
   attend that the conference will fail to protect them in other ways.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  If I’m missing anything please let me know.
 </p>

 <p>
  On the flip side, what impact does banning Yarbin have?
 </p>

 <p>
  Note that people go to a technical talk because they believe the
  information may be interesting or useful to them.
 </p>

 <p>
  Knowledge that might be available elsewhere, but they take the time
  to go to a technical talk because they believe that learning in that
  way will likely be easier or more accessible to them.
 </p>

 <p>
  Thus, when you ban people from going to a technical talk, you deny
  people access to technical knowledge.
 </p>

 <p>
  Regardless of who they are.  They might be a person of color, they
  might be gay, they might be a woman, they might be a straight white
  male, they might be liberal or conservative.
 </p>

 <p>
  Perhaps they find the speaker’s views outside the talk repugnant,
  sickening, disgusting, counterproductive, harmful to society.
 </p>

 <p>
  As a free individual, they have the right to decide
  for <i>themselves</i> that this technical knowledge is more
  important to them than such revulsion they may feel.  Or not.
 </p>

 <p>
  Unless we take that right away from them.  Unless we deny them
  their agency.  Unless we decide <i>for them</i> that we are not
  going to allow <i>them</i> to learn from a talk that they wish to
  learn from.
 </p>

 <p>
  Not everyone who has been systematically excluded believes the
  solution is to exclude them some more.
 </p>

 <p>
  Once we accept the necessity, the desirability, the usefulness
  of excluding people from technical knowledge as a tool to fight
  racism against them, where does it end?
 </p>

 <p>
  I imagine it’s likely many people who signed the Statement see no
  reason to go any further, and such concerns would be entirely
  hypothetical if no one wants to go see a talk by Yarvin anyway.
 </p>

 <p>
  The Statement was clearly written with the best and highest of
  intentions.  However, if we stop and consider for a moment not
  the <i>intentions</i> of those who signed the Statement, but what
  the Statement <i>says</i>, would not many of the same arguments
  apply to a page in a functional programming wiki about written by
  Yarvin about Urbit?
 </p>

 <p>
  To a publisher selling a book about Urbit written by Yarvin?
 </p>

 <p>
  To a library lending a book about Urbit?
 </p>

 <p>
  What about those who we judge is 95% as racist as we judge Yarvin to
  be?  50% as racist?  20% as racist?  What other technical knowledge
  do we attempt to exclude people from in order to fight exclusion
  against them?
 </p>

 <p>
  The desire to take a strong stand against racism is commendable.  As
  a <i>strategy</i> to fight exclusion, excluding people from
  attending technical talks is <i>lousy</i>.
 </p>

 <h2>Making a Statement</h2>

 <p>
  The Statement states that allowing Yarvin to give a technical talk
  on Urbit, allowing people to attend a technical talk on Urbit,
  says to marginalized people that their humanity is up for debate.
 </p>

 <p>
  In a purely <i>literal</i> sense that’s not really true, since talks
  at LambdaConf aren’t allowed to debate people’s humanity, they’re
  restricted to the technical topic.
 </p>

 <p>
  But it does have symbolic value.
 </p>

 <p>
  If someone takes a costly action in support of something they claim
  to believe, that lends <i>credibility</i> that they actually believe
  it.
 </p>

 <p>
  For example, if someone were to confront a racist bully at a risk
  to themselves, that would lend credibility to their statement that
  they oppose racism... that they’re not merely claiming, “oh, I’m not
  a racist” without bothering to do anything about it.
 </p>

 <p>
  The next step however, that we should take that strong action <i>in
  order to</i> demonstrate that we actually do care about racism, has
  a bug in it.
 </p>

 <p>
  Suppose the signatories of the Statement are successful, and Yarvin
  is banned.
 </p>

 <p>
  What happens next year?
 </p>

 <p>
  We’ve made a powerful <i>symbolic</i> statement, but haven’t done
  anything to <i>actually</i> reduce racism.  In fact, racism is still
  a huge problem.
 </p>

 <p>
  And alarmingly, with the power of the Internet, racism could easily
  become <i>worse</i>.  Harrassing people used to take effort, but
  with the Internet now one person can harrass and bully hundreds of
  people while sitting on their couch munching on potato chips.
 </p>

 <p>
  So, next year we wish to continue to make a strong statement against
  racism.  However, we’ve <i>already</i> banned the neoreactionaries.
  Doing <i>nothing</i> doesn’t make a strong statement.  In order to
  make the strong statement <i>again</i>, we’ll need to find someone
  <i>else</i> to ban.
 </p>

 <p>
  If we could do something that would <i>actually</i> defeat racism,
  we could do that thing, instead of making statements about it.
 </p>

 <p>
  Banning Yarvin in order to <i>send a message</i> that we really care
  about marginalized people is an admission that we don’t know what to
  do to <i>actually</i> help marginalized people.  It’s a concession
  of defeat.
 </p>

 <h2>A warm welcome</h2>

 <p>
  When do we cross the line into abuse of power, at the risk enabling
  bullying and intimidation?
 </p>

 <p>
  Not that we <i>intend</i> to do that of course!  But in an objective
  sense, not looking at intentions, but at actual outcomes, where’s
  the line?
 </p>

 <p>
  The essential dividing line is whether the use of force is necessary
  and minimal.
 </p>

 <p>
  As one example of a policy, we could say that making racist comments
  is not allowed at a conference, and if someone does they will be
  told to stop, and if don’t stop they’ll be told to leave, and if
  they don’t leave we’ll call the police, and if they’ve don’t listen
  to the police they’ll be removed in handcuffs.
 </p>

 <p>
  That’s not to say this should be the <i>only</i> policy, but just to
  point out that in the example of this particular policy each step
  is <i>necessary</i> to enforce the policy, and also
  the <i>minimal</i> amount of force that
  <i>needs</i> to be used at each step.
 </p>

 <p>
  What happens when we decide that it’s OK to eject someone from a
  conference or to prevent them to speak at a conference, not because
  that will actually <i>do</i> anything, not because that will
  actually <i>prevent</i> any racism, but because we want to make a
  statement <i>about</i> racism and to keep people from feeling
  offended?
 </p>

 <p>
  Who gets to decide who gets banned, blacklisted, fired from their jobs?
 </p>

 <p>
  The majority.
 </p>

 <p>
  There’s a hope expressed in the Statement that by banning
  neoreactionaries, the rest of us can then enjoy a warmly welcome
  conference together.
 </p>

 <p>
  Which might be true.
 </p>

 <p>
  However we’re saying that it’s OK to oppose offensive opinions not
  just with words, but also with force.
 </p>

 <p>
  And while I’m sure this the last thing any of the signatories of the
  Statement would want, using force to silence opinion is the action
  of a bully.
 </p>

 <p>
  Our hope may be to only cause fear and intimidation for the
  neoreactionaries, but an unfortunate result is to also create fear
  and intimidation for others who may hold an unpopular opinion that
  the majority finds offensive.
 </p>

 <h2>Fighting Racism</h2>

 <p>
  Imagine for a moment that we’re <i>successful</i> at fighting
  racism.  That we <i>win</i>!
 </p>

 <p>
  What would the path to get there look like?
 </p>

 <p>
  To change behavior, people find a small reinforcement which is
  immediate and consistent is more effective than a large one which is
  delayed and occasional.
 </p>

 <p>
  For example, a small punishment which is certain and immediate is
  more effective at deterring crime than the possiblity of a large
  punishment happening later.
 </p>

 <p>
  Thus while making large dramatic gestures such as banning people
  feels good, I suspect that being successful will turn out to instead
  require a multitude of small steps, a million small efforts.
 </p>

 <p>
  To make it so that someone doesn’t get to engage in racist behavior
  for one weekend is a small, unimpressive victory.  And yet it is an
  actual victory.
 </p>

 <p>
  Is LambdaConf’s adjustment to their code of conduct and their policy
  changes exactly the right steps that are needed?
 </p>

 <p>
  Probably not yet.
 </p>

 <p>
  However LambdaConf is taking the time and making the effort
  to <i>figure out</i> what needs to be done to effectively oppose
  racism.
 </p>

 <p>
  I support LambdaConf because I believe such efforts are more likely
  to actually be <i>successful</i> in ending racist behavior.
